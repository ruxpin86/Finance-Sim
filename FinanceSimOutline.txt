) Add a “random market events” system (crashes, booms)
    Start with market-wide events: -Interest rates -GDP numbers -Retail Sales/Consumer Spending -Manufacturing 
    -Financial Crisis -Pandemic -Geopolitical tensions (war, sanctions) -Elections

    Starter List of Events (Event/Outcome/Probability):
        >Recession = all assets -15% (25% every 3rd year)
        >Tech Surge = ETFs +15% and Stocks +8% (20% every year)
        >Crypto Crash = Crypto -25% (25% every year)
        >Pandemic = all assets -35% (3% every year)
        >Favorable Election = Stocks +8% ETFs +12% (50% every 4th year)
        >Lower Interest Rates (LIR) = Bonds +10% (for 3 years following 'Recession' OR 'Pandemic' event)
        >>>Multiple events can happen each year, but...
            'Recession' blocks a 'Tech Surge' for that year.
            'Recession' cannot occur back-to-back
            'Recession' and 'Crypto Crash' can occur in the same year
            'Recession' resets the interest rate timer
            'Pandemic' cancels the chance of all other events except 'Recession' and resets 'Recession' clock regardless.
                'Recession' has a 33% chance of occurring during 'Pandemic'
                'Favorable Election' cannot override 'Recession' during a 'Pandemic'
                'Pandemic' will trigger 'LIR' even without 'Recession'
                'LIR' cannot stack if both 'Pandemic' and 'Recession' occur in same year
                'Crypto Crash' can occur during 'Pandemic'
            'Recession' of any kind block 'Tech Surge' for that year
            'Recession' or 'Pandemic' resets timer to 6 years 
            'Favorable Election' nullifies 'Crypto Crash'
            In non-'Pandemic' years 'Favorable Election' prevents a 'Recession'
            'Favorable Election' overrides 'Recession' occurring.
            'LIR' can stack with other positive events.
        >>>All events should occur before annual contributions.
        Events Hierarchy:
        1. Pandemic
        2. Recession
        3. Favorable Election
        4. Tech Surge
        5. Crypto Crash
        6. Lower Interest Rates (activate when condition is met)
    Variables:
        recession_pandemic_blocked_years_remaining = 6
        tech_surge_blocked_years_remianing = 1
        crypto_crash_blocked_years_remaining = 1
        election_year_interval = 3
        LIR_years_remaining = 3
    
    Example Scenario:
        Year 12: 'Pandemic' occurs
            recession_pandemic_blocked_years_remaining = 6
            tech_surge_blocked_years_remianing = 1
            crypto_crash_blocked_years_remaining = 0
            LIR_years_remaining = 3
            election_year_interval = 0 
        Year 13: Therefore looks like this...
            recession_pandemic_blocked_years_remaining = 5
            tech_surge_blocked_years_remianing = 0
            crypto_crash_blocked_years_remaining = 0   
            LIR_years_remaining = 2
            election_year_interval = 3

    KINDA Pseudocode:
    
    This is inside a function called def roll_random_event() 
    All counters are == 0 
    probability is rolled for each event 
    this function returns a boolean value for each roll 
    if the boolean is true then the corresponding counter is set 
    election_year_interval = 3 
    after the roll counters are decremented after the roll with the exception of election_year_interval 
    
    next I would define a function called def apply_random_event_return(asset_balances) 
    this will loop over each asset and apply the random event effect to each asset 
    this would return the asset_balances back to main to then be calculated and passed along to the next year
            

FOR LATER
) Add additional asset classes
) Offer preset portfolio templates ("Aggressive", "Moderate", etc.)
